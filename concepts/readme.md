This folder contains concordances, frequency matrices and mds coordinates for the concepts used in our case studies.

## concordances:
- concordance_lemma.ctok (only with lemmas)
- concordance_lemmapos.ctok (with lemmas and their part of speech taggers)
- concordance_lemmaposppmi.ctok (with lemmas, their part of speech taggers and postive pointwise mutual information [ppmi] collocation values)

## frequency matrices
- freq0ppmi1llr1.ttmx.pac (filtered by positive pointwise mutual information [ppmi] and log likelihood ratio [llr])

## mds coordinates for visualization
- mds_fit.csv
